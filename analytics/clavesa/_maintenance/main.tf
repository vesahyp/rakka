# clavesa maintenance pipeline (opt-in, GH #53).
#
# OPTIMIZEs and VACUUMs the workspace system bookkeeping tables under
# _system/pipelines (node_runs, runs, tables, column_stats) so their Delta
# transaction log and small-file count stay bounded. Compaction is a
# scheduled, observable pipeline instead of hidden on the per-node write path.
#
# This pipeline is scaffolded but NOT deployed. Enable it with
# 'clavesa pipeline deploy _maintenance' (it runs on the daily schedule
# below), or delete this directory to opt out. The runner already has S3 +
# Glue write to the workspace-owned system catalog, so no extra IAM is needed;
# it touches only the system tables, never another pipeline's outputs.
